### 'Fair-License' - The only License for:
- ... [✔] **open contribution & open economic sustainability.**
- ... [✔] **non-commercial repurposing & same-purpose distribution, <br> without generally allowing commercial exploitation, without requiring license-virality. <i> For example as "Dual licensing", such as: "GNU for everything, except commercial useage" </i> ) 

This license can serve as a placeholder, for any project already attracting volunteer work, yet without any smart contract.  
(This draft "v0.3" attempts to explain to every reader and be legally precise-enough too. ( _Talk to us? ☺ Are you into international law?_ )

### COMMENT / POSTAMBLE / DISCUSSION :

"WHY RESTRICT COMMERCIAL USE?" 
- That's just like asking: "Why tax commercial companies?" "Why does society believe in public goods?" 
- Open development and public goods need not be underpaid or paid uncertainly. They need not force themselves to exhaust their productivity and still hardly keep up, even when actually having chosen a worthy and self-sustaining cause.
   - One can decide per case, what commercial licenses to sell or not. To set certain moral requirements and avoid exploitation but not give general unconditional, permanent, unpredictable licenses (_but rather monthly renewal or SaaS_)
- Commercial activity is always taxed and essentially defined through its restriction. And defining it (if all work would be a non-commercial, then tax would not need to exist.)
- "Restricting commercial-use" is simply closest to a legally implemented version of: "Restricting greed". 
- Non-profit work can increase when not disadvantaged. ( _And non-profits should increasingly receive fair / easy subsidy / minus-tax_ )  
- "WILL RESTRICTING COMMERCIAL-USE SLOW DOWN DEVELOPMENT?"
  - Commercial work is prepared for tax / paperworks anyways. ( _Which can be automatic / easier through decentralization_ )
  - Commercial development varies, for many modern, complex and specific projects. Often or mostly it is hard to imagine, that requiring to ask first, will hinder good causes. ( _While asking might help to connect, motivate or inspire each other_).

"WHY NOT REQUIRE LICENSE-VIRALITY?" 
 - While general purposes infrastructure might be / need to be completely free (Dentralizaton and crypto, dApps) (and can be under a viral license since no modification needs to be anybody's property or private, yet smart contracts can also easily cover specifics for any smaller projects, such as votings / fair payments. There is no one-fit-all. You can (should?) consider to release your work under multiple licenses as needed and with any exceptions.
 - Virality means 'exponential growth indicator', so forcing viral development sounds supportive, besides not all open software might needs or deserves the same strategy.
   - Implementations of license-virality, such as GNU, allow commercial exploitation permanently and without requiring to add anything. This doesnt necessarily fit or protect specific, small or young projects.
     - Some publishers add adware or spyware to open source works. Such versions can exceed the popularity of the originals. ( _Visibility might not be balanced or fair. Billions of users might not review every software they chose. Thus authors should care?_ (Or at least it is not always helpful to give ownership to every commercial entity by default) ( Caring for the present reality of a project does not contradict the overally hope or tendency for more efficient and friendly behavior to grow, exceeding careless choices eventually.)
